## Description

This project is a command line interface application that uses MYSQL, Node.js, express and sequelize to create and manage a database and the data held within it. It combines the powerful sequelize with node.js and express to enable15 different routes to Retrieve, create, update, and delete data in a databse named ecommerce_db. It stores information on various products for an e-commerce website, and can tak in multiple points of data for each item.

Some challenges I faced were:
Debugging, debugging, debugging! This was a great exercise in debugging, as getting all the various players (SQL, node, express etc.) to talk to one another without bugs was challenging! It was very satisfying to get it all up and running and working smoothly.

## User Story

My motivation for making this was:
As a user, I wanted a way to store items on mye-commerce site in a detailed, organized manner.
